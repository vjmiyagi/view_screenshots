# View Screenshots
## Or How I take Lecture Notes...
I used to get frustrated during Zoom lectures if I tried to follow along as we are encouraged to do.  Make a typo and you end up falling behind and miss stuff and then have to wait for the lecture video to post.

NUTS TO THIS!  There is a much better way to handle it.  First grab a screenshot of the code you need while it is displayed and then use the Jupyter Notebook, ViewScreenShots, to display.

There is an app I like for screenshots called [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html).  Once installed, to use it hit your Print Screen key and it will grey out your display.  Using your mouse, draw a box around the area you want a shot of and then click the save icon.

To save time, during lecture I let LightShot name the file.

# Prepare for lecture!

In your folder you plan to use for your assignment, add a folder named images.  In that same folder make sure you have a copy of the Jupyter Notebook.  Not using Jupyter Notebooks?  No problem just upload the notebook to Google Colab. [Follow these instructions](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html) so Colab can use your local runtime.

This works best if you have at least two monitors.  I use three so I can have the Lecture on 1, my Screenshot Viewer notebook on the second one and my follow along notebook on the third.

# Hope it works for you!

An added note of caution...should you forget to change your directory for LightShot, you may end up with shots you used to answer a Facebook post...
